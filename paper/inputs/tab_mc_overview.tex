    Method &    & Limitations &   \\ \hline
    Multicut \cite{andres_2011_iccv,kappes_2011_emmcvpr} & 
        (I)LP & 
        not scalable, slow &
        Cutting plane method.
        Global optimal but slow for huge problems. 
        However, applicable for medium size superpixel RAG. 
        \\ \hline
    Expand And Explorer \cite{bagon_2011_arxiv} & 
        movemaker & 
        gets stuck early &
        $\alpha$-Expansion modification. Applicable to
        large scale problems but gets stuck in local minima(???).
        \\ \hline
    Fast Planar CC \cite{yarkony_2012_eccv} & 
        dual-decompositon & 
        planar graphs only, 
        duality/integrality gab &
        Dual decompositon in planar subgraphs??
        Works on planar graphs only. Fast (is there a word for fast to medium fast) for
        small to medium size graphs.
        \\ \hline
    Cut Glue and Cut \cite{beier_2014_cvpr} & 
        move-making & 
        gets stuck in poor minima for non planar graphs &
        Greedy solver based on a series of 2 colorings.
        State of the art any time performance. Very
        fast for planar graphs. Gets stuck in local minima
        for non planar graphs.
        \\ \hline
    THIS WORK & 
        fusion move-making & 
        no natural stopping condition &
        Fusion of a proposal segmentation with
        the current best segmentation.
        State of the art any time performance for (???)
