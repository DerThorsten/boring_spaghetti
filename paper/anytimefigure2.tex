    Among all tested solvers, the proposed method is the only
    one scaling to large 3D data.
    Except for the small 3D block, CC-Fusion finds very low
    energies one to three magnitudes faster 
    than any other method.
    With increasing block size, is outperformed even more.
    For the 2D datasets CGC is very fast, but our proposed
    solver finds lower energies while still being faster
    than the global optimal multicut solver.
